customer service phone calls are bad, but transactions are nice and quick.

there is nothing like in the market, the app has great functionalities. i did a lot of market research, but nothing comes close to this. One the other hand, i am a bit frustrated and tired of customer service calls. most of the time i failed to get any effective advice.

i love the customer service response time and effectiveness. they are very professional and ready to help whenever i needed most. however, the mobile installation crashes and losses data. i think their new release broke most of it. it is bad!
